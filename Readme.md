To make lemon water, squeeze half a lemon into 8 ounces of warm or cold water. To make the drink as healthy as possible, use filtered water and organic lemons.

Infuse more flavor or add a health boost to lemon water by adding:

a few springs of mint
a teaspoon of maple syrup or raw honey
a slice of fresh ginger
a dash of cinnamon
a sprinkle of turmeric
You can also add slices of other fresh citrus fruits such as limes and oranges, or cucumber slices. Always wash the produce well before slicing and using.
